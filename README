These scripts general and print various geometry parameters for RNA.

All scripts require a Phenix environment.
All scripts can be run from anywhere.

rna_precis_and_suitename.py wraps the other two scripts and generates a complete parameterization.
  For most purposes, you should run this.

rna_precis_and_suitename.py supports some commandline arguments
elbow=False will prevent execution of elbow/readyset - this will significantly increase speed, but will leave residues not covered in geostd unparameterized
complete_only=False will suppress output lines for any residue wihtout a complete parameterization


Example:
phenix.python rna_precis_and_suitename.py PATH/filename.pdb
phenix.python SOMEPATH/rna_precis_and_suitename.py elbow=False complete_only=True ANOTHERPATH/filename.pdb

Other scripts:
Other scripts are found in the rna_scripts module folder

rna_suite_parameters.py runs ready_set on a a file to generate .cif restraint files
  The option to skip elbow is currently only available when running it via the rna_precis_and_suitename.py wrapper
  Then it uses the mmtbx.mp_geo rna_backbone=True machinery to generate RNA backbone torsions
  These are formatted for use with suitename

rna_precis_parameters.py calculates our new minimal-atom RNA parameters.
  It currently seems to have some problems with generating complete results.  I'm working on that.


readyset_temp is temporary holding for ready_set results, created in your current working dir. It should be deleted at the end of each run.
rna_suite_parameters.py will create and delete this dir as necessary.
Passing cleanup_after_readyset=False will preserve this dir for debugging purposes.
